  description: "<p>Developed with academics from the University of Manchester: School
    of Social Sciences, Department of Law and Manchester Metropolitan University:
    Department of Social Care and Social Work, Uncertain Futures is an art and research
    project where the women, all activists and leaders in their communities, have
    formed an Advisory Group, met weekly over the past 15 months, and stayed connected
    despite Covid. Working collectively to advocate for policy change, they have identified
    and made public the issues confronting older women and work, particularly in the
    context of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br> <br>The Advisory Group and their partners
    have co-designed a unique programme of art, research and advocacy that naturally
    follows the three pillars of age-friendliness: connectivity, giving a platform
    and a voice to the issues raised, and celebrating age. Uncertain Futures has shown
    the group that the issues that affect women over 50 are what connect them; ageing
    is a shared experience, whatever their background, heritage and culture, and they
    are their own best advocates for change.</p>"
- description: "<p>Manchester Art Gallery is the original useful museum, initiated
    in 1823 by artists, as an educational institution to ensure that the city and
    all its people grow with creativity, imagination, health and productivity. The
    gallery is free and open to all people as a place of civic thinking and public
    imagination. It promotes art as a means to achieve social change with its origins
    from the Royal Manchester Institution for the Promotion of Literature, Science
    and the Arts. It has been at the centre of city life for nearly 200 years and
    has been proudly part of Manchester City Council since 1882. The gallery is for
    and of the people of Manchester. Through its collections, displays and public
    programmes it works with all our constituents to ensure creativity, care and consideration
    infect all aspects of the way we live. This is an art school for everybody and
    for life. <br><br><em>“This has been the most wonderful project to witness, evolving
    into something with true power and emotion, that has the potential to effect so
    many lives in the city. The Gallery has a long history as a city centre institution
    that has given a platform to support the rights of women. Suzanne Lacy has done
    what she does best – to listen and use art to create the space and time to give
    people a voice. Uncertain Futures clearly shows this: the convening role our museums
    can have for the people of Manchester.”</em><br><strong>Alistair Hudson</strong>,
    Director of Manchester Art Gallery<br></p>"
