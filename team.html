      The Project is led by Los Angeles artist Suzanne Lacy and Ruth Edson,
      under the auspices of the Manchester Gallery of Art. It is a multiyear
      project with many partnerships and collaborators operating in unison on
      different strands:




      · The *Participatory Research* project, led by Dr. Sarah Campbell and Dr. Elaine Dewhurst, uses social science methodologies and intersectional themes in ageing, law, and social care to produce a publishable report with Advisory Group members.




      · The *Artistic Producers* include filmmaker Mark Thomas and curator Natasha Howes and many other photographers, designers, performance and film producers, who create the individual artworks that represent the activities and goals of the entire project.




      · The *Advisory Group*, comprised of a group of 15 women activists over 50, citizens and workers from across Manchester who represent the voices of women from their diverse communities, use community organizing and media strategies to produce social engagement and advocacy.
