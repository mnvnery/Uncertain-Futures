  info: "<p>The outcomes of this research will impact change in our communities. Besides
    the participatory research reports and recommendations, this involves a number
    of events and public engagement opportunities as well as learning opportunities.
    The Research Team will develop key recommendations for action in the form of a
    manifesto. We are committed to recommendations which are sustainable, real, and
    will change womenâ€™s lives for the better.</p>"
- title: Theme 4
  info: "<p>We want to recognise the stories that are shared by the participants relating
    to the kinds of inequalities faced by them or the exclusion or lack of access
    that they have experienced due to discrimination and inequalities. Some examples
    of issues discussed here include: discrimination on the basis of race, disability
    and age, as well as the impact of gender discrimination arising from having children
    and raising a family.</p>"
  subtitle: Inequalities and Exclusion (including structural inequality and discrimination)
- title: Theme 3
  info: "<p>In this theme, we are eager to capture the stories that women share about
    what they do, the value they bring to society and the kinds of resilience, strength
    and endurance they exemplify. This includes issues such as the skills of older
    women, their experiences and contributions, particularly during the pandemic.
    </p>"
  subtitle: Recognition, Contribution and Endurance
- title: Theme 2
  info: "<p>This theme encourages us all to think about the choices and opportunities
    or even the lack of such choices and opportunities which our participants have
    faced. It represents examples and stories of the kinds of choices available, or
    not, or the kinds of unforeseen circumstances that women find themselves in, or
    the kinds of opportunities that are or were available to them in their lives.
    This includes issues such as the impact of Covid, the menopause, housing and migration.
    </p>"
  subtitle: Choices and Opportunities
- title: Theme 1
  info: "<p>In this theme we will be analysing the narratives to uncover the particular
    situations of the participants and to examine the factors and the circumstances
    which have influenced them in making certain decisions or taking certain actions.
    This includes issues such as culture, gender, family and finances.</p>"
  subtitle: Circumstances that influence decision making
- title: 'Overview '
  subtitle: ''
  info: '<p class="MsoNormal">Substantive and publishable research is a key aspect
    of our work, alongside activist and aesthetic productions. The research plan and
    outcomes are noteworthy in the realms of aging/labor research and participatory
    research.</p><p>Between September 2022 and March 2023, the participatory research
    team will be co-analysing the anonymized interviews of 100 older women. The co-analysis
    of interviews is being done by our research team, led by the researchers from
    the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University and includes
    Advisory Group members: Atiha Chaudry, Rohina Ghafoor, Marie Greenhalgh and Tendayi
    Madzunzu.</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, the participatory element of the project
    is central to the work. The Advisory Group of 14 women represent an extremely
    diverse and empowered cross section of the Manchester population and have been
    participants in every aspect of the project, from the determination of areas to
    research, the questions, the recruitment of interviewees, and the analysis of
    data.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Second, the cross section of 100 interviews is so
    deeply representative of the intersectional issues faced by Manchester women that
    we feel the data pool is truly unique in the world of such studies. The work resulting
    from this research endeavor is bound to make a difference in local, perhaps national
    communities and among policy makers.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The research question
    being investigated is: "What are the inequalities facing women over 50 in relation
    to work?" From the interviews themselves we have isolated a number of key themes
    which we will be updating as our research progresses. Our analysis will be updated
    as it is completed.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>'
