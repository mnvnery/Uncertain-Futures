title: 'Project Narrative '
info: '<h2><em>January 2019-September 2022</em></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><em>Uncertain
  Futures</em> is a participatory arts-led research project involving several elements,
  and working across different disciplines, with different approaches. It combines
  art, research, and activism through which, together, it aims to achieve social change.</p><p
  class="MsoNormal"><em>Uncertain Futures</em> addresses inequalities facing Manchester
  women over 50 relating to work and worklessness in order to understand how interconnected
  issues of gender, age, labour, class, migration status, disability and race impact
  women’s paid and unpaid work. Manchester has higher than the national average rates
  of worklessness in the 50-64 age group, with 1-in-3 economically inactive. The unexpected
  change that raised the pension age for women across the UK and the impact of Covid-19
  on working lives created an urgent need to investigate and bring these issues to
  public attention.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The project is comprised of three key
  areas of work: a series of aesthetic productions organized and presented through
  three sequential exhibitions at the Manchester Art Gallery; a significant participatory
  research project, accompanied by multiple public presentations and a final paper;
  and an activist organizing project aimed at raising the level of awareness about
  intersectional issues around work and aging.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The project
  was formed through the vision of American artist Suzanne Lacy working with Learning
  manager Ruth Edson at Manchester Art Gallery who undertook a fact-finding series
  of focus groups and identified researcher Dr. Sarah Campbell as a team member to
  lead the participatory research project.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The first stage
  was to undertake a consultation across Manchester with various organisations and
  women’s groups to discuss with diverse groups of women over 50 questions about the
  pertinent issues facing ageing women in the workplace. The changes in The Pensions
  Act 2011 accelerated the rise of the state pension age to 66 for both men and women
  but the issue, as we discovered, was far deeper than the increase in age for women.</p><p
  class="MsoNormal">Dr. Elaine Dewhurst joined the team as the consultations drew
  to a close in early 2020, just as Covid-19 began to emerge and impact working lives
  around the world, particularly affecting older people. Manchester Art Gallery closed
  to the public and exhibitions were postponed. However, like many organisations,
  work went online. From March through August of 2020, a series of on-line conversations
  were hosted virtually by Manchester Art Gallery and Suzanne Lacy. Activists, academics,
  arts professionals, policymakers and representatives from organisations were invited
  to discuss issues regarding work for older women and topics like “care practices”
  emerged in the museum field as a result of Covid. The conversations continued over
  a number of months, and ideas regarding the project were developed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In
  September 2020, an Advisory Group of 15 women was formed. This group, who advised
  on all aspects of the project, represented a diverse group of women who were active
  in their communities, from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, women whose
  ages ranged from 50 – 80, women who were newly migrated to the city and others who
  had lived in Manchester all of their lives. Weekly meetings were held virtually
  to develop project goals and co-design a gallery installation and a ‘data matrix’
  of key intersectional experiences around work. Through their communities the Advisory
  Group recruited 100 women from varied cultures with different experiences to take
  part in interviews held in the gallery.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In June 2021 the
  first of three planned exhibitions opened at the Manchester Art Gallery. This installation
  served as an actual interview room with a window opening out from the room where
  the interviews would take place during museum hours and where anonymized interviews
  were posted after each interview. The installation consisted of this “recording
  studio,” transcribed interviews, and a dramatic soundtrack and video projection
  that played in the window when interviews were not going on. During this installation,
  workshops, talks and media presentations that explored equity and survival took
  place, extending the work of the project into the Manchester public sphere.</p><p
  class="MsoNormal">In March 2022, the 100 women interviewed were invited to a celebratory
  gala dinner at the Manchester Art Gallery with a program led by Advisory Group members.
  Alongside this, the group hosted ‘chai and chat’ gatherings, a civic programme of
  skills-based workshops, and public presentations.</p><p>In September 2022, the second
  of three installations opened at the Manchester Art Gallery, meant to provide an
  in-depth review of the structure and process of the project and a second film, projected
  on a second window of the recording studio.</p><p></p><p><img src="/assets/img/img_9523.jpg"
