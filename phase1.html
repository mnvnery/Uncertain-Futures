title: Project Phase 1
info: "<p>Phase 1 of the project ran from January 2019 to September 2022. Uncertain
  Futures is a participatory arts-led research project involving several elements,
  and working across different disciplines, with different approaches. It combines
  art, research, and activism through which, together, it aims to achieve social change.
  In June 2021 the exhibition opened with live interviews taking place with 100 women
  over 50 from all walks of life, alongside workshops, talks and media presentations
  that explored equity and survival. The 100 women came together for a celebratory
  dinner in March 2022 which you can see in the film on display at Manchester Art
  Gallery.</p><p></p><h3>Team Members</h3><p>The artistic production team, led by
  artist Suzanne Lacy and Manchester Art Gallery staff Ruth Edson, uses visual and
  community organizing strategies to design an interdisciplinary work featuring social
  engagement and advocacy. The research team led by doctors Sarah Campbell and Elaine
  Dewhurst, works within social science methodologies and intersectional themes in
  ageing, law, and social care to produce a publishable report. The Advisory Group
  is comprised of a group of 15 women activists, citizens and workers from across
  Manchester who bring their own individual experiences of being women over 50, and
  who represent the voices of women from their communities. The Manchester Art Gallery
  hosts the project to facilitate socially engaged innovations in their programme
  that foster greater inclusiveness and social benefit.</p><p></p><h3>The Process</h3><p>The
  project was formed through the vision of American artist Suzanne Lacy and Ruth Edson
  at Manchester Art Gallery. Lacy’s work focuses on issues of inequality and poverty
  and previously with Manchester Art Gallery she explored the precarious working lives
  of domestic workers in Manchester. ‘Cleaning Conditions’ (2013) highlighted inequalities
  that were experienced by predominantly migrant women working in the sector. Themes
  that emerged from this earlier project were a focus of the present work on older
  women and work and a partnership was formed with researchers at the University of
  Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University.</p><p></p><p>The next stage was
  to undertake a consultation across Manchester with various organisations and women’s
  groups to discuss with diverse groups of women over 50 questions about the pertinent
  issues facing ageing women in the workplace. The changes in The Pensions Act 2011
  accelerated the rise of the state pension age to 66 for both men and women but the
  issue, as we discovered, was far deeper than the increase in age for women. The
  consultation drew to a close in early 2020, just as Covid-19 began to emerge, and
  impact working lives around the world, particularly affecting older people. Manchester
  Art Gallery closed to the public and exhibitions were postponed. However, like many
  organisations, work went online.</p><p></p><p>From March through August of 2020,
  a series of on-line conversations were hosted virtually by Manchester Art Gallery
  with Suzanne Lacy. Activists, academics, arts professionals, policymakers and representatives
  from organisations were invited to discuss issues regarding work for older women.
  The conversations continued over a number of months, and ideas regarding the project
  were developed. Women over 50 were invited to commit to being part of the ongoing
  project. In September 2020, an advisory group of 15 women was formed. This group
  represented a diverse group of women who were active in their communities, from
  different racial and ethnic backgrounds, women whose ages ranged from 50 – 80, women
  who were newly migrated to the city and others who had lived in Manchester all of
  their lives.</p><p></p><p>Weekly meetings were held virtually to develop project
  goals and co-design a gallery installation and a ‘data matrix’ which identified
  the key intersectional experiences to examine in relation to four areas of focus:
  accessing work, in-work, exiting work and the impact of Covid. Through their communities
  the advisory group recruited 100 women from varied cultures with different experiences
  to take part in interviews held in as part of an exhibition in the gallery, which
  now houses their anonymised transcripts as artifacts. The installation featured
  an on-going activation of the actual interview process by the researchers as they
  privately recorded participants experiences.</p><p></p><p>In March 2022, the 100
  women interviewed were invited to a celebratory gala dinner at the Manchester Art
  Gallery with a program led by Advisory Group members. Alongside this, the group
  have hosted ‘chai and chat’ gatherings, a civic programme of skills-based workshops,
  and public presentations. A new gallery installation opens in September 2022 to
  focus on the achievements of the project thus far. The research team including researchers
  and Advisory Group members, are analysing the collected interviews, while others
  continue the ongoing campaign work to raise awareness. Project participants plan
  to produce a manifesto of recommendations from the research and a documentary film
  in the coming year.</p>"
