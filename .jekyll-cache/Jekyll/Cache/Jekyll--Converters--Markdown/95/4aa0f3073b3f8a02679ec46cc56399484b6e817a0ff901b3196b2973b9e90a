I"†<p><em>Uncertain Futures</em> is an unique art and research collaborative work which aims to highlight and analyse the intersectional inequalities facing women over 50 around work. This includes inequalities relating to gender, age, race, disability, migration status and other statuses. The project was initially developed by artist Suzanne Lacy with an Advisory Group formed of women over 50 from Manchesterâ€™s diverse communities in association with Manchester Art Gallery and Manchester City Councilâ€™s Work and Skills Team. It is supported by a research team from the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University. The title is taken from the research consortium <em>Uncertain Futures: Managing late-career transitions and extended working life</em> led by Professor Sarah Vickerstaff.</p>

<p>This website has been created to merge the lived work experiences of women over 50 in Manchester with legal and social policymaking and age discrimination case law and to offer arts and research-based strategies for interdisciplinary collaboration. The aim of <em>Uncertain Futures</em> is to create real social change and effect social policy.</p>
