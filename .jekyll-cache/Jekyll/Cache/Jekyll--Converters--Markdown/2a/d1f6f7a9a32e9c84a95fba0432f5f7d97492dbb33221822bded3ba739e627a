<p>· The <em>Artistic Producers</em> include filmmaker Mark Thomas and curator Natasha Howes and many other photographers, designers, performance and film producers, who create the individual artworks that represent the activities and goals of the entire project.</p>

<p>· The <em>Advisory Group</em>, comprised of a group of 15 women activists over 50, citizens and workers from across Manchester who represent the voices of women from their diverse communities, use community organizing and media strategies to produce social engagement and advocacy.</p>
