I"â<p>Substantive and publishable research is a key aspect of our work, alongside activist and aesthetic productions. The research plan and outcomes are noteworthy in the realms of aging/labor research and participatory research.</p>

<p>Between September 2022 and March 2023, the participatory research team will be co-analysing the anonymized interviews of 100 older women. The co-analysis of interviews is being done by our research team, led by the researchers from the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University and includes Advisory Group members: Atiha Chaudry, Rohina Ghafoor, Marie Greenhalgh and Tendayi Madzunzu.</p>

<p>First, the participatory element of the project is central to the work. The Advisory Group of 14 women represent an extremely diverse and empowered cross section of the Manchester population and have been participants in every aspect of the project, from the determination of areas to research, the questions, the recruitment of interviewees, and the analysis of data.</p>

<p>Second, the cross section of 100 interviews is so deeply representative of the intersectional issues faced by Manchester women that we feel the data pool is truly unique in the world of such studies. The work resulting from this research endeavor is bound to make a difference in local, perhaps national communities and among policy makers.</p>

<p>The research question being investigated is: ‚ÄúWhat are the inequalities facing women over 50 in relation to work?‚Äù From the interviews themselves we have isolated a number of key themes which we will be updating as our research progresses. Our analysis will be updated as it is completed.</p>
