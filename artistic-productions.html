    June 2021 – September 2022</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Uncertain Futures exhibition
    opened on 24 June 2021 with 100 live interviews taking place with women over 50
    in a booth in the gallery. The interviews were transcribed and anonymised and
    displayed on clipboards for visitors to read. A sound and text piece played in
    the gallery when interviews weren’t taking place sharing the experiences of the
    work for the 14 members of the Advisory Group.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 100
    women came together for a celebratory dinner in March 2022 to honour their commitment
    and to thank them for sharing their stories, their intellect and their positive
    energy. This was a key networking opportunity and chance to share and develop
    agency about issues affecting women over 50 and work.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/img_9584.jpg"></p><p>Photo

    2: The Process</em></p><p>In the second iteration of the exhibition, we reveal
    the development of the <em>Uncertain Futures</em> and initial research findings.
    The project continues as interviews are being analysed by our research team. This
    website has been created to merge the lived work experiences of women over 50
    in Manchester with legal and social policymaking and age discrimination case law.
    <em>Uncertain Futures</em> combines art, research and activism and aims to create
    real social change and affect social policy.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/cf075346-1.tif"
