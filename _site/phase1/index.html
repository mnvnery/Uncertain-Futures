        <h1 class="bold mb-5">Project Phase 1</h1>
        <div class="team-text mb-5 phase"><p>Phase 1 of the project ran from January 2019 to September 2022. Uncertain Futures is a participatory arts-led research project involving several elements, and working across different disciplines, with different approaches. It combines art, research, and activism through which, together, it aims to achieve social change. In June 2021 the exhibition opened with live interviews taking place with 100 women over 50 from all walks of life, alongside workshops, talks and media presentations that explored equity and survival. The 100 women came together for a celebratory dinner in March 2022 which you can see in the film on display at Manchester Art Gallery.</p><p></p><h3>Team Members</h3><p>The artistic production team, led by artist Suzanne Lacy and Manchester Art Gallery staff Ruth Edson, uses visual and community organizing strategies to design an interdisciplinary work featuring social engagement and advocacy. The research team led by doctors Sarah Campbell and Elaine Dewhurst, works within social science methodologies and intersectional themes in ageing, law, and social care to produce a publishable report. The Advisory Group is comprised of a group of 15 women activists, citizens and workers from across Manchester who bring their own individual experiences of being women over 50, and who represent the voices of women from their communities. The Manchester Art Gallery hosts the project to facilitate socially engaged innovations in their programme that foster greater inclusiveness and social benefit.</p><p></p><h3>The Process</h3><p>The project was formed through the vision of American artist Suzanne Lacy and Ruth Edson at Manchester Art Gallery. Lacy’s work focuses on issues of inequality and poverty and previously with Manchester Art Gallery she explored the precarious working lives of domestic workers in Manchester. ‘Cleaning Conditions’ (2013) highlighted inequalities that were experienced by predominantly migrant women working in the sector. Themes that emerged from this earlier project were a focus of the present work on older women and work and a partnership was formed with researchers at the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University.</p><p></p><p>The next stage was to undertake a consultation across Manchester with various organisations and women’s groups to discuss with diverse groups of women over 50 questions about the pertinent issues facing ageing women in the workplace. The changes in The Pensions Act 2011 accelerated the rise of the state pension age to 66 for both men and women but the issue, as we discovered, was far deeper than the increase in age for women. The consultation drew to a close in early 2020, just as Covid-19 began to emerge, and impact working lives around the world, particularly affecting older people. Manchester Art Gallery closed to the public and exhibitions were postponed. However, like many organisations, work went online.</p><p></p><p>From March through August of 2020, a series of on-line conversations were hosted virtually by Manchester Art Gallery with Suzanne Lacy. Activists, academics, arts professionals, policymakers and representatives from organisations were invited to discuss issues regarding work for older women. The conversations continued over a number of months, and ideas regarding the project were developed. Women over 50 were invited to commit to being part of the ongoing project. In September 2020, an advisory group of 15 women was formed. This group represented a diverse group of women who were active in their communities, from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, women whose ages ranged from 50 – 80, women who were newly migrated to the city and others who had lived in Manchester all of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Weekly meetings were held virtually to develop project goals and co-design a gallery installation and a ‘data matrix’ which identified the key intersectional experiences to examine in relation to four areas of focus: accessing work, in-work, exiting work and the impact of Covid. Through their communities the advisory group recruited 100 women from varied cultures with different experiences to take part in interviews held in as part of an exhibition in the gallery, which now houses their anonymised transcripts as artifacts. The installation featured an on-going activation of the actual interview process by the researchers as they privately recorded participants experiences.</p><p></p><p>In March 2022, the 100 women interviewed were invited to a celebratory gala dinner at the Manchester Art Gallery with a program led by Advisory Group members. Alongside this, the group have hosted ‘chai and chat’ gatherings, a civic programme of skills-based workshops, and public presentations. A new gallery installation opens in September 2022 to focus on the achievements of the project thus far. The research team including researchers and Advisory Group members, are analysing the collected interviews, while others continue the ongoing campaign work to raise awareness. Project participants plan to produce a manifesto of recommendations from the research and a documentary film in the coming year.</p></div>
