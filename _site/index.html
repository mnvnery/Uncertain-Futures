<h1 class="bold">About<br>the Project</h1>
<div class='information-text'><p>Uncertain Futures is a collaborative artwork highlighting intersectional issues around work for women over 50 focusing on gender, age, race, disability and class. <br><br>Developed by artist Suzanne Lacy with an advisory group formed of women over 50 from Manchester’s diverse communities, Manchester Art Gallery and Manchester City Council’s Work and Skills team, Uncertain Futures aims to co-research conditions around access to work, within work and leaving work for women over 50. <br><br>It is produced in partnership with the University of Manchester: School of Social Sciences, Department of Law and Manchester Metropolitan University: Department of Social Care and Social Work and is a MICRA seedcorn programme. The interviews began on 24 June 2021 and we achieved our target of interviewing 100 women on 18 Sept 2021. The interviews took place in a booth in the gallery.</p></div>
