<h1>About the team</h1>
<div class="information-text"><p>Developed with academics from the University of Manchester: School of Social Sciences, Department of Law and Manchester Metropolitan University: Department of Social Care and Social Work, Uncertain Futures is an art and research project where the women, all activists and leaders in their communities, have formed an Advisory Group, met weekly over the past 15 months, and stayed connected despite Covid. Working collectively to advocate for policy change, they have identified and made public the issues confronting older women and work, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br> <br>The Advisory Group and their partners have co-designed a unique programme of art, research and advocacy that naturally follows the three pillars of age-friendliness: connectivity, giving a platform and a voice to the issues raised, and celebrating age. Uncertain Futures has shown the group that the issues that affect women over 50 are what connect them; ageing is a shared experience, whatever their background, heritage and culture, and they are their own best advocates for change.</p></div>

<h1>Manchester Art Gallery</h1>
<div class="information-text"><p>Manchester Art Gallery is the original useful museum, initiated in 1823 by artists, as an educational institution to ensure that the city and all its people grow with creativity, imagination, health and productivity. The gallery is free and open to all people as a place of civic thinking and public imagination. It promotes art as a means to achieve social change with its origins from the Royal Manchester Institution for the Promotion of Literature, Science and the Arts. It has been at the centre of city life for nearly 200 years and has been proudly part of Manchester City Council since 1882. The gallery is for and of the people of Manchester. Through its collections, displays and public programmes it works with all our constituents to ensure creativity, care and consideration infect all aspects of the way we live. This is an art school for everybody and for life. <br><br><em>“This has been the most wonderful project to witness, evolving into something with true power and emotion, that has the potential to effect so many lives in the city. The Gallery has a long history as a city centre institution that has given a platform to support the rights of women. Suzanne Lacy has done what she does best – to listen and use art to create the space and time to give people a voice. Uncertain Futures clearly shows this: the convening role our museums can have for the people of Manchester.”</em><br><strong>Alistair Hudson</strong>, Director of Manchester Art Gallery<br></p></div>
